Malware Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms for malware detection as discussed in the paper "Malware Analysis and Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms" by Akhtar, M.S. and Feng, T. (2022).

Abstract
Malware is a significant threat in today's digital landscape, with polymorphic malware posing a challenge to traditional signature-based detection methods. This research explores the use of machine learning algorithms to detect and classify malware, focusing on techniques such as feature extraction from PE headers, DLLs, and API calls, as well as decision tree models and random forests.

Aim
The main aim of this research is to develop effective malware detection systems using machine learning algorithms.

Objectives
